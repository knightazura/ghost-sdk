To do that, Lucy uses the Content screen (Manage Posts) - http://cl.ly/NyOy

* When Lucy clicks on a post in the left hand column, the post is loaded into the right hand column. By default, the first post is selected.
* If Lucy clicks on the "All Posts" dropdown, she can choose which order to display posts in, or to search for a specific post. - http://cl.ly/NxkQ
* The post list has no other functions other than to select a post to preview.
* At the top of the post list, Lucy can click on the + button to start writing a new post. This will take her to the post editor (#5) with a blank post loaded.
* Once Lucy has selected a post to preview, she can perform a number of actions on it in the preview pane:
* Clicking on the *Star* icon in the header makes the post featured. Clicking on it again un-features the post.
* Clicking on the *Edit* icon in the header takes lucy to the post editor (#5) with this post loaded.
* Clicking on the *Settings* icon in the header loads the post settings menu (The same as the one in the bottom right-hand corner of the editor - #5) - http://cl.ly/Nyvd

Other notes:

* The preview pane can be styled via the theme
* The markup/output of the preview pane cannot be edited, only CSS.
