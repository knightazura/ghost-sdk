A place to collect ideas for apps and specifically things that the apps need to be able to do.

The idea here is to list a high level goal, and then document what API/[GDT](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/wiki/Imagining-the-Ghost-Developer-Tools) features are needed to achieve it.

If you have an idea, please add it to the list no need to break it down into features!

* Embed analytics code into every page
   * Be able to filter ghost.head or ghost.foot (need renaming)
* Embed comments into posts / pages
   * Add configuration settings to the admin
   * Have access to a `{{comments}}` helper
* Modify RSS feeds
   * Be able to filter rss.feed and rss.item
