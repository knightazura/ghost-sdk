Welcome to the Ghost repository!

This document is intended as a one-stop shop for getting started with contributing to the codebase. Please feel free to add anything you find to be missing.

## Getting Started with the Codebase

You first port of call should probably be the [working on ghost core](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost#working-on-ghost-core) guide in the readme which details all the dependencies you need to build Ghost from the repo.

## Code Standards

All code should conform, strictly, to the Ghost project [Code Standards](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/wiki/Code-standards).

All HTML and CSS should conform to the [Code Guide](http://github.com/mdo/code-guide), maintained by [Mark Otto](http://github.com/mdo).

## Getting stuck in

Work is very much underway towards achieving version 0.3. You can find out the plan by reading the [Version 0.3 Roadmap](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/wiki/Roadmap#version-03---kickstarter-access---est-16th-september) and also take a look at the [issue list](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues?milestone=2&state=open). If you see any issue you are interested in working on, let Hannah know by leaving a comment or dropping her a message in IRC/Skype.

If you have ideas for something you'd like to implement or improve which isn't on the roadmap, feel free to open issues and PRs for these. Opening a PR or Gist for a refactor or idea for something is often the best way to get a discussion started.

## Submitting Changes

Please read the [Git workflow](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/wiki/Git-workflow) documentation with regard to writing commit messages, opening Pull Requests, branching strategies and other general git process related stuff.
