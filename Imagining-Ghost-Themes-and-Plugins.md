Creating the API for plugins and themes is a balancing act. We want to provide flexibility and power whilst still having one clear way to do things. WP plugins are a higgledy piggledy mess. There is no convention or structure, everyone invents their own and as such it is very difficult to appraise plugins for code quality.

I want to ensure consistency and provide clear conventions whilst not enforcing any conventions which are restrictive. Conventions should add power, reliability and reassurance that code will function well, not enrage the developers.

Admin Plugins

- single, multi-level additional menu item.
- custom fields
- blog screen
- settings?

3rd Party Integrations

Special kind of plugin? :/
