If you're trying to determine whether or not a feature you're interested in will be implemented in Ghost core, there are 4 key principles:

- Is it fundamentally core to publishing digital content? Would it likely be useful to the majority of our user base? If yes, then it will probably be in Ghost core. E.g I18n, post scheduling, etc.
- Is it so large and complex that other companies have entire teams and infrastructures dedicated to it? Then it will probably be provided through 3rd party integrations. E.g. Comments, and media management.
- Is it only relevant to a small group, or for a short time / one off use? If yes, it is probably app territory. E.g. XML-RPC, Import tools
- Is it only possible to achieve by adding to or modifying core? If yes, then it will be considered in terms of benefit vs complexity.

These are the guiding principles, they are somewhat subjective but they provide a framework for anyone to use to interpret whether or not a feature might be considered for Ghost core. There will always be exceptions.

When making a feature request, keep in mind that Ghost is a publishing platform for the masses. It's aim is to be the go-to solution for publishing content to the web - we want to do one thing, REALLY well. The aim of the Ghost architecture is to provide for the most common use cases in Ghost core and provide for extensibility so that less common use cases can be catered for with apps and extensions.
