[work in progress]

Ghost is made up of two main folders:

* **content**  - contains the files which may be added or changed by the user such as themes and plugins. See content/README.md for more info
* **core** - contains the core files which make up Ghost. See core/README.md for more info

There is also a **docs** directory generated by groc for annotated source code. Please keep this in mind when adding to the codebase :)

There are a number of additional files in the root directory:

* app.js is the main file for ghost.
* config.js contains settings most of which should live in the settings db table & be managable via the dashboard, but we anticipate there being both kinds of settings/config
* npm-shrinkwrap.json and .afignore are both for deploying to appfog and will probably disappear soon
* .groc.json is for generating docs
* config.rb is settings for compiling the admin sass

Hopefully everything else is self explanatory
