[IntelliJ](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) is the recommended IDE for developing Ghost - whether you're working on core, themes, or plugins, IntelliJ has full support for Node.js and several other tools that Ghost makes use of.

IntelliJ is a fully-fledged IDE, you can use it for developing Java just as easily as JavaScript. It does have a little brother [WebStorm](http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/), which should [work just as well for Node.js](http://blog.jetbrains.com/webide/2011/11/webstorm-your-node-app/) :)
