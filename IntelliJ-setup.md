[IntelliJ](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) is the recommended IDE for developing Ghost - whether you're working on core, themes, or plugins, IntelliJ has full support for Node.js and several other tools that Ghost makes use of.

IntelliJ is a fully-fledged IDE, you can use it for developing Java just as easily as JavaScript. It does have a little brother [WebStorm](http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/), which should [work just as well for Node.js](http://blog.jetbrains.com/webide/2011/11/webstorm-your-node-app/) :)


### Setting up a Project



### Plugins

Under settings (win) / preferences (mac) -> plugins -> browse repositories

Select and install Nodejs & Handlebars/Mustache plugins

### Keyboard / Mouse shortcuts

IntelliJ has awesome shortcuts, take some time to get to know them. 

Under settings (win) / preferences (mac) -> Keymap 

In the search/find box: Type 'go'

You'll see entries for `Declaration` and `Implementation` which allow you to click on variables/functions & take you to the declaration or implementation. These are super useful for JS. Learn them or reassign them to something you'll remember.

In the search/find box: Type 'usage'

Assign `Find Usages` to something like Cmd/Ctrl + Button2 Click by right-clicking on it and choosing 'Add mouse shortcut'. Cmd/Ctrl + Button 2 click on any variable or function name will then open a find box with all usages of that variable/function.

IntelliJ is a power tool - take some time to learn the keybindings and discover what they do!
