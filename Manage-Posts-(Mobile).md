This story is nearly identical to [Manage-Posts](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/wiki/Manage-Posts), with a few exceptions:

Tablet:

* The post list is loaded - http://cl.ly/NzaL
* When the user clicks on a post, the entire content area flies off to the left (iOS style)
* Simultaneously to the above, the post preview flies in from the right - http://cl.ly/NzFp
* Clicking the back button takes the user back to the post-list

No other changed actions.

Mobile:

* Identical to tablet - some UI elements move slightly - http://cl.ly/NzXX

No changed actions
