User story for settings management. This is the main screen - http://cl.ly/O6v7

* User arrives on settings screen
* By default the first item in the list is selected
    * Use history API to remember the last sub-section the user was on and return to it?
* The settings relevant to the currently-active menu item are on the right
* The user can update the settings, and save them with the save button, top-right
    * Do we need a save button?
* Clicking on menu items on the left dynamically loads in the settings for other areas

Tablet workflow: Exactly the same, but smaller columns http://cl.ly/O6sC

Mobile workflow: Split into 2 pages, like other screens detailed http://cl.ly/O7TY
