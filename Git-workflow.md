[Forking Workflow](http://www.atlassian.com/git/workflows#!workflow-forking)

##Quick Summary

Each developer should fork the private core Ghost repo into a private repo of their own and clone this as their local repo.

Once a change is ready to be added back to the core repo, a pull request should be issued. For the immediate future only, all pull requests will be handled by Hannah Wolfe.

Be sure to pull from the core repo regularly :)
