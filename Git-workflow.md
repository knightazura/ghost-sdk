[Forking Workflow](http://www.atlassian.com/git/workflows#!workflow-forking)

**Please note:** I will always try to merge your pull request, or at least give a reason why your pull request has not been merged, within 24 hours at the absolute latest.

##Quick Summary

Each developer should fork the private core Ghost repo into a private repo of their own and clone this as their local repo.

Once a change is ready to be added back to the core repo, a pull request should be issued. For the immediate future only, all pull requests will be handled by Hannah Wolfe.

Be sure to pull from the core repo regularly :)

## Working with issues

Feel free to start work on any issue which is not assigned. Please leave a comment on the issue to say you wish to pick it up, and it will get assigned to you.
