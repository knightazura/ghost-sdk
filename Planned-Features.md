One of the questions we get asked the most is (when) will Ghost do X?

We have a list of features that we plan to implement which is as long as a gorilla's arm, and it's hard to communicate. This list attempts to quantify that list, detail the finer points where we know them, and will be expanded upon as it becomes clearer how a feature will fit into Ghost. 

If you're looking for a short answer to whether or not a feature will be implemented, the principles are:

- Is it a feature that is fundamentally core to publishing digital content? If yes, then it will probably be in Ghost core. E.g I18n, post scheduling, etc.
- Is it something so large and complex that other companies have entire teams and infrastructures dedicated to it? Then it will probably be provided through 3rd party integrations. E.g. Comments, and media management.
- Is it something that almost every blogger will need all the time? If no, it's probably plugin territory. E.g. XML-RPC, Import tools
