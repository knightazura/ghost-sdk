The Roadmap aims to set out when certain features will appear. It reduces in clarity the further we go into the future, and is constantly being added to as we move forward.

If you're just looking to find out whether a feature is likely to end up in core or not, then take a look at the [planned features page](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/wiki/Planned-Features). It's just a list, but we're adding more detail to it as we go.

## The Public Roadmap

The wiki Roadmap has been replaced with a [public trello board](https://trello.com/b/EceUgtCL/ghost-roadmap), to make it easier for everyone to keep track of ongoing work. If you would like to receive regular updates on our progress, you can subscribe to the [Dev Blog](http://dev.ghost.org) which is updated weekly after the public developer meeting.

## GitHub Backlogs

We now have just two Milestones on GitHub: 
- [Current Backlog](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues?milestone=22) - contains high priority issues which we really want to ship in the next release
- [Next Backlog](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues?milestone=21) - contains issues which are ready to be worked on
- [Future Backlog](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues?milestone=6) - contains issues which aren't ready to be worked on yet

The idea is that any issue in the 0.5.x backlog can be picked up and worked on. If the PR gets merged, the code goes out in the next release. We ask developers to use the [roadmap](https://trello.com/b/EceUgtCL/ghost-roadmap) as a guide to which features are most important for the next release, but this only covers features, not technical improvements or bug fixes.
