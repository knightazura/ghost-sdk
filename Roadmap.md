The Roadmap aims to set out when certain features will appear. It reduces in clarity the further we go into the future, and is constantly being added to as we move forward.

If you're just looking to find out whether a feature is likely to end up in core or not, then take a look at the [planned features page](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/wiki/Planned-Features). It's just a list, but we're adding more detail to it as we go.

## Future Milestones

### Milestone 4 - Version 0.4.0 - Early / mid December

The next minor version bump is set to happen a month or so after the public launch
