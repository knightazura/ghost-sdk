The Roadmap aims to set out when certain features will appear. It reduces in clarity the further we go into the future, and is constantly being added to as we move forward.

If you're just looking to find out whether a feature is likely to end up in core or not, then take a look at the [planned features page](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/wiki/Planned-Features). It's just a list, but we're adding more detail to it as we go.

## Version 0.4.1

### Early February

It is anticipated that there will be a 0.4.1 maintenance release a few weeks after 0.4 purely to iron out some bugs

## Milestone 5 - Version 0.5.0 - Apps & Import

### Spring 2014

This is the current Milestone

Focuses on the app boilerplates, API, filters, importers, permissions, security and other app related things, to bring the first iteration of Ghost Apps to the public.

## Milestone 6 - Version 0.6.0 - Multi-user and Localisation

### Early Summer 2014

Secondly, on providing the tools for l10n & i18n - making it possible for you to use Ghost in your language, and to publish blogs in any language.
