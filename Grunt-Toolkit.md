Ghost has a number of tasks which are automated via Grunt. You can also get help when running grunt by typing `grunt --help`

Alternatively, the GruntFile now has [inline documentation](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/master/Gruntfile.js#L599) giving you an overview of the tasks. The documentation generated from the inline comments can be viewed in a temporarily home on [dropbox](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/531857/ghost/docs/Gruntfile.js.html#custom%20tasks), we'll be moving the annotated source code to a permanent home in due course.
